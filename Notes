==>Angular localhost port number is 4200
==>In Angular there are Some Components,files,folders   
==> In 'package.json we can see all dependencies -> rxjs which is library etc'

==> angular.json is for cinfig files All the config files are avalible in angular.json
=>index.html itis a single page which load bcoz every this is load in <app-root></app-root>
==> main.ts it is ts extension , it is like entry point to angular 

==>src/app is a main application 
==> in app.modules.ts basically we make a component which will declare in it
==> app.components.html which is for design
==> app.component.spec.ts is for testing

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
==> So now lets design ,For design we have to goo app.html and remove every thing
==>Now <h1>{{title }}</h1> is whatever the title of project we can see in output
which we can also see in app.component.ts title,is we change there title name then our output will also change
==>in HTML i will add .toUppercase then whole text will in uppercase and also we can sum there

==>we also have style.css which is for styling whole application

==>now if we want to make new component then write in terminal that 'ng g c component name'
                                            if we want component in components folder then 'ng g c components/name'
==> we have to implements oninit 
                add constructor(){}
                and ng OnInit(): void {}---it is a life cycle method, it is used most to inilize the code
==> we make header OKAY so in app.component.html we will write <app-header></app-header>
===>if we usediv class container in app.component.html then all in container
==> if we cut title from app.component.ts and paste in header.component.ts upper in constructor 
and lets design in header.html inside the header tag <header></header> 
and now in header.css we write how we want 
==> now we add button in terminal ng g c components/button

==> In button.html we add<app-button></app-button>
                                And in button.html we design
                                if we want to colour the button then header.html make class name color
        ==> if we style then in button.html we can

        Same all in every components
